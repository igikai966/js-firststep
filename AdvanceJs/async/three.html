    <h1>ERROR HANDLING</h1>
    <p>If a promise resolves normally, then await promise returns the result. But in the case of a rejection, it throws 
        the error, just as if there were a throw statement at that line.</p>
    <script>
        async function f(){
            await Promise.reject(new Error("Whoops!"));

        }

        async function f(){
            throw new Error("Whoops!");
        }
        //In real situations, the promise may take some time before it rejects. 
        // In that case there will be a delay before await throws an error.

        //We can catch that error using try..catch, the same way as a regular throw:

        async function f(){

            try{
                let response = await fetch(`https://no-such-url`);
            }catch(err){
                alert(err);
            }
        }
        f();
